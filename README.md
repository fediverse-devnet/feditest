# Feditest: test federated protocols such as those in the Fediverse

This repo contains:

* the FediTest test framework

which allows you to define and run test plans that involve constellations of servers (like Fediverse instances) whose communication you want to test.

The actual tests for the Fediverse are in their own [repository](https://github.com/fediverse-devnet/feditest-tests-fediverse).

For more details, check out [feditest.org](https://feditest.org/) and find us on Matrix in [#fediverse-testing:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23fediverse-testing:matrix.org).

# Feditest: test federated protocols such as those in the Fediverse

This repo contains:

* the FediTest test framework

which allows you to define and run test plans that involve constellations of servers (like Fediverse instances) whose communication you want to test.

The actual tests for the Fediverse are in their own [repository](https://github.com/fediverse-devnet/feditest-tests-fediverse).

For more details, check out [feditest.org](https://feditest.org/) and find us on Matrix in [#fediverse-testing:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23fediverse-testing:matrix.org).

Found a bug? You must be kidding; like in all of Arch Linux, there are no bugs in this software. But if we happen to be wrong, submit a bug report with as much detail as possible right here for this project on Github.

    A Node is the interface through which FediTest talks to an application instance.

    There are (also abstract) sub-classes that provide methods specific to specific
    protocols to be tested. Each such protocol has a sub-class for each role in the
    protocol. For example, client-server protocols have two different subclasses of
    Node, one for the client, and one for the server.

    Any application that wishes to benefit from automated test execution with FediTest
    needs to define for itself a subclass of each protocol-specific subclass of Node
    so FediTest can control and observe what it needs to when attempting to
    participate with the respective protocol.
